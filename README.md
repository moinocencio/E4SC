**BLDC Motor Controller made for Electronics 4 Class**

This is a very simple project made for a curricular unit from Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at Universidade de Aveiro.

The main initial contributors from this project are myself and luismof7 (https://github.com/luismof7), but any kind of feedback would be appreciated.

The motor controller tries to implement some basic functions, like max top speed, PWM control for speed maintenance, bluetooth control, ...

We hope to add more and more functionalities to the controller, to get to a point where it is a viable option to implement on a small RC plane (or something like that).
